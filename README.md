# RungeKutta
This repository includes MATLAB code for solving a nonlinear differential equation using Runge Kutta 4 (RK4). Moreover, the solution is evaluated using ode45 function in MATLAB.
In order to use the RK4 method to solve a DE, first the the equation should be stated in first-order format. Higher-order equations can be re-written using order reduction method.  
The nonlinear differential equationadopted here is: 
F(x,y) = 3.*exp(-0.1*x)-0.4*y + y*sin(x)
