In numerical analysis, the Rungeâ€“Kutta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the Euler method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of simultaneous non linear equations.
So RK4 as a general format of the RK is a numerical method to solve differential equations, specifically the nonlinear ones.
